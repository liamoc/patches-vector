name:                patches-vector
version:             0.1.6
synopsis:            Patches (diffs) on vectors: composable, mergeable, and invertible.
description:         A patch is a collection of modifications (edits) to be made to a sequence of elements. Commonly
                     found in version control systems, patches are also a simple example of a groupoid, supporting (partial) composition
                     and inversion.
                     .
                     This library provides a pleasant interface for working with patches to vectors with any type of element.
                     It includes patch composition, inversion, and application, as well as a way to compute a patch between
                     two vectors using the Wagner-Fischer algorithm.
                     .
                     It also includes a simple implementation of the Operational Transform (OT) function to resolve
                     diverging patches from the same document. This allows for reasonably painless implementation of merge
                     functions, as well as many applications in distributed editing of documents.
